## Description

Wildlife tracking is a popular activity for nature enthusiasts, as well as an important activity in scientific wildlife preservation. These observations produce large volumes data (from camera traps to geo-location data), organized into databases that can be used for various purposes, from environmental activism to environmental protection policy. In this course, we will concentrate on the two kinds of bird-related data and learn to work with these datasets in order to claim data processing skills for design and art.

Working with two archives of animal observation will bring out the intricacies of data collection in the wild and emphasize the contradiction between the perceived 'wilderness' of birds and their continuous tracking. We seek to unfold narratives and stories from the data, and find unexpected, irregular and even incorrect observations.
